## Firefox Saved Password Attack {#firefox_saved_password_attack}

-   Name: Firefox Saved Password Attack
-   OS: n/a
-   Language: HTML/PHP
-   Path: <http://svn.skullsecurity.org:81/ron/security/firefox-saved-password>
-   Created: Old
-   State: Not working

I wrote this to implement a cross-site scripting attack that could be used to harvest passwords from Firefox. It\'s currently working, so either it\'s been fixed in Firefox or, equally likely, I didn\'t leave it in a good state.

    svn co http://svn.skullsecurity.org:81/ron/security/firefox-saved-password
