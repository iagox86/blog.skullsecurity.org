These are absolutely my favourite!

Instructions:

-   Take portabello mushrooms, break off stems and scrape off gills
-   Chop mushrooms into cubes, \~1 - 2cm
-   Marinade in about 50/50 mix of lemon juice and Worcestershire sauce, with a little bit of liquid smoke (optional) for an hour or two
-   Coat with corn starch, fry on high heat until they\'re dark and crispy
