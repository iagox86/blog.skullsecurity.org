This is an old recipe that, from what I understand, originated at a local restaurant down the street from where my parents grew up. My mom makes her version of this occasionally, which is very greasy, and they put it on everything. My version,since there\'s no ground beef in it, is far less greasy and is actually pretty good for you.

One thing hasn\'t changed, though \-- this stuff is awesome on everything. Pasta, bread, hotdogs (veggie dogs?), french fries, etc etc etc.

Anyway, here\'s my version:

-   One large onion (or two medium onions), diced
-   3-5 cloves of garlic, minced
-   2 cans of beans (I used pinto + navy, but only because that\'s what I had on hand)
-   2 cans of tomatoes (I used one crushed + one diced, again because that\'s what I had)
-   2 tbsp chili powder
-   1 tbsp cumin
-   1 tbsp oregano
-   1 tbsp cocoa
-   2 tsp salt
-   1 tsp celery seeds
-   1 tsp turmeric
-   2 tsp cinnamon
-   1/2 tsp crushed red pepper flakes
-   2c vegetable broth

Procedure:

1.  Cook onions/garlic in oil until soft and translucent
2.  Add everything else, simmer for at least 30 - 45 mins
