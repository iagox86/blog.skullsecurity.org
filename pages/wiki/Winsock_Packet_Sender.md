## Winsock Packet Sender {#winsock_packet_sender}

-   Name: Winsock Packet Sender
-   OS: Windows
-   Language: Visual Basic 6
-   Path: <http://svn.skullsecurity.org:81/ron/old/wsps>
-   Created: Old
-   State: Complete, I think

I wrote this when I was new to Visual Basic to learn how networking worked. It can send packets on the specified port and receive responses. Nothing fancy.

    svn co http://svn.skullsecurity.org:81/ron/old/wsps
