This is a recipe from La Dolce Vegan that I have adapted, I think it turned out pretty well! Not too salty, nice onion flavour (There, but not overpowering), and mushrooms!\
\
Ingredients:\
\
4-6 button mushrooms\
2 Tbsp vegan margarine\
3 Tbsp flour\
1/4 tsp pepper\
1/4 tsp spices\
1/2 tsp chopped garlic\
1 cup onion soup stock\
\
You will need a small pan to work with for this.\
Chop/slice your mushrooms, then heat the pan and melt the margarine.\
Add the mushrooms to the pan and saute until soft. During this time you may also add your chosen spices and the garlic.\
Once your mushrooms are cooked, add the flour and pepper. Mix everything together and you should end up with a gooey paste in the pan.\
Add the soup to this mixture and stir well. The paste should completely mix with the stock, and will quickly thicken.\
Continue to heat on low to medium heat for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. You may let the gravy cool before serving, or serve immediately.
