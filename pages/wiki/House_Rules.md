## Death

(Note: This is basically the same as death from D&D 3.0 (and possibly other editions of D&D))

When a character\'s current hitpoints fall to 0, he is conscious but unable to do anything. If they reach -1 or lower, he falls unconscious until he recovers enough to return to 0. When below 0, he will lose 1hp/turn until he is stabilized. A character can be stabilized in two ways:

-   He rolls percentile lower than his Constitution (he is given one chance to roll each turn)
-   Another character makes a successful First Aid check

If the character\'s hitpoints reach -10, he\'s dead.

## Raising Skills {#raising_skills}

When raising skills, a player receives an additional 5 + 1d6 points, instead of 1d10.
