So, this started out as a mushroom soup that I ended up freeforming into a cream stew. Turned out quite well, I think.\
\
Ingredients:\
\
200g white button mushrooms\
1 medium yellow onion\
4 cloves garlic\
1/4 cup vegan margarine\
1/2 cup pilsner\
spices to taste\
4 Tbsp flour\
2 cups soy milk (unflavoured)\
2 cups vegetable stock\
2 cups onion soup stock\
5 medium potatoes\
\
Chop up mushrooms and onion, and crush garlic.\
Finely chop potatoes, then set aside.\
Mix onion, garlic, mushrooms and margarine together in large pot and saute for 9 minutes.\
Add spices and pilsner, then cook for a further 8 minutes. Pilsner should completely reduce.\
Add flour to form a roux.\
Add soy milk and soup stocks and mix together, then add potato and cook on low to medium heat until potato is cooked (approximately 30 minutes depending on potato chunk sizes).
