## Brute

-   Name: Brute

-   Created: Old
-   State: Complete

A long time ago, I chained together bkhive, samdump2, and rcrack. They allow you to take a \"sam\" file with the associated \"system\" file, turn them into a pwdump file, and crack them with rainbowtables. It was tested and worked a few years back, it\'s completely untested with any new OS (Windows XP SP2, SP3, Windows 2k3 SP1, Vista, etc). If somebody wants to give it a try, please let me know how it goes!
