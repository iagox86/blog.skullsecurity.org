-   1 box extra firm silken tofu
-   2 Tbsp. olive oil
-   1 Tbsp. apple cider vinegar
-   3 Tbsp. Earth Balance margarine
-   4 oz. nondairy sour cream (Tofutti Better Than Sour Cream)
-   1/4 tsp. paprika
-   1/4 tsp. nutmeg
-   Pinch of cayenne
-   Pinch of fresh ground pepper
-   Pinch of turmeric
-   a dash of salt
-   1 Tbsp. lemon juice
-   2 vegan English muffins (some have honey, so read that label), lightly toasted
-   8 slices of vegan Canadian bacon (Yves brand or other ham-like vegan deli slices)
-   4 slices of tomato

1.  Preheat the oven to 450ÂºF.
2.  Cut the tofu into 4 slices so that the slices are 4\" by 3\", then use a drinking glass to cut tofu into circles about the size of the English Muffin.
3.  Arrange tofu circles in a single layer in an oiled baking dish.
4.  In a small bowl, whisk together the vinegar, salt, and olive oil and pour the mixture over the tofu.
5.  Bake the tofu for 15 minutes, turning it over after 8 minutes, 20 seconds. (We are just trying to get a little extra flavor into the tofu and heat it. You could use vegetable broth instead of the oil and vinegar, or you could marinate the tofu overnight in veggie broth. The Hollandaise sauce will be the dominating flavor so don\'t worry too much about flavoring the tofu. It is, after all, just pretending to be a poached egg.)
6.  To make the hollandaise sauce, melt the vegan margarine in a small saucepan over medium to low heat.
7.  Stir in the nondairy sour cream, paprika, nutmeg, cayenne, pepper, turmeric and lemon juice. Make sure that the mixture is heated through but don't allow it to boil. Hollandaise should taste buttery, the second flavor should be lemon, the third taste should be pepper. Then the other spices should be there, but underneath.
8.  Top each English muffin half with a slice of tofu, 2 slices of Canadian "bacon," and a slice of tomato (I like to broil the tomato briefly beforehand on top of the Canadian bacon to get everything hot), and a generous ladle of hollandaise sauce.
9.  Garnish with a sprig of fresh parsley or basil or whatever herb you grow and then serve.
