This is the original Battle.net NickSpoofer written by scbackstab.com\'s Yoshi. He gave me this code when I was first learning VB, and I promised never to distribute it. I figure that, since this is 6 years later, it no longer works, and he\'s dropped off the face of the Internet, the deal is probably relaxed.
