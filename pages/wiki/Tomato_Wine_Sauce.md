I had wine sauce at a restaurant and liked it, so I took a stab at making it. It wasn\'t quite the same, but still good!

-   1/2 onion, diced
-   2 cloves garlic
-   1c wine (I used cooking sherry)
-   1 can pureed tomatoes (2c or so)
-   Vegetable broth (to thin, if desired)
-   Thyme (to taste)
-   Oregeno (to taste)
-   Basil (to taste)

Sautee onion and garlic in a little bit of oil until they brown slightly, mix everything else except the broth together, cook for 10 mins, puree with hand blender (unless you like it chunky) and add vegetable broth to thin, if desired (I don\'t).
