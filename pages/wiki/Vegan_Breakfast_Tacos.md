Found this [here](http://smarterfitter.com/blog/2009/07/06/vegan-breakfast-tacos/), and love it! I made a few little modifications

-   1 tsp olive oil
-   1/4 green pepper, finely chopped
-   1/2 red onion, finely chopped
-   1/2 jalapeno, finely chopped (optional)
-   1 cup firm tofu, cubed
-   2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
-   2 heaped tablespoons salsa (or more!)
-   1 tsp olive oil
-   1/4 green pepper, finely chopped
-   1/2 red onion, finely chopped
-   1/2 jalapeno, finely chopped
-   1 cup firm tofu, crumbled
-   2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
-   2 heaped tablespoons salsa
-   Hot sauce (to taste)
-   1/4 cup cilantro, finely chopped (optional \-- I hate cilantro, so I leave it out)
-   salt
-   3 tortillas (corn or flour)
-   1/2 avocado, diced (optional \-- I dislike avacado)

1.  In a frying pan, heat up the olive oil on medium heat. Add the green pepper, jalapeno and onion and saute until the onion just starts to brown.
2.  Add the tofu, garlic, salsa, as much hotsauce as you want, and a sprinkle of salt and saute for about 3-5 minutes, until the tofu has cooked a bit but isn't overly dry. Check the flavor and add more salt if necessary.
3.  Remove the tofu from heat and stir in the cilantro. Divide the tofu mixture into the three tortillas and top each with diced avocado. Sprinkle the avocado with a little bit of salt, add more salsa if desired and serve! (Personally, I make them into wraps then throw them in the oven on broil to toast them a bit)
