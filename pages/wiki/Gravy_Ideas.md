From [This site](http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Vegetarian-Gravy/Detail.aspx)

-   1/2 cup vegetable oil
-   1/3 cup chopped onion
-   5 cloves garlic, minced
-   1/2 cup all-purpose flour
-   4 teaspoons nutritional yeast
-   4 tablespoons light soy sauce
-   2 cups vegetable broth
-   1/2 teaspoon dried sage
-   1/2 teaspoon salt
-   1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper

DIRECTIONS

1.  Heat oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Saute onion and garlic until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in flour, nutritional yeast, and soy sauce to form a smooth paste. Gradually whisk in the broth. Season with sage, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat, and simmer, stirring constantly, for 8 to 10 minutes, or until thickened.
