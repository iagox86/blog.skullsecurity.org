## War2Decode

-   Name: War2Decode
-   OS: Windows, compiles (and untested) on Linux
-   Language: C++
-   Path: <http://svn.skullsecurity.org:81/ron/old/War2Decode>
-   Created: Old
-   State: Complete

This was my initial reversing of the Warcraft 2 CDKey Decode function (which happens to be the same as the Diablo 2 function). If I recall correctly, there was a bug in this implementation that caused certain keys to decode improperly.

    svn co http://svn.skullsecurity.org:81/ron/old/War2Decode
