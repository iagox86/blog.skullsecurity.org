-   8 ounces wide, flat rice noodles
-   2 tbsp lime or lemon juice
-   1 tsp soy sauce
-   2 tbsp ketchup or chili sauce
-   1 tsp sriracha sauce (or hot sauce that\'s not too vinegary, or 1/2tsp crushed red pepper))
-   2 tsp oil
-   2 tsp minced garlic
-   1 tsp grated ginger
-   1 carrot, cut into matchsticks
-   3 green onions, cut on the diagnol into 3/8-inch lengths
-   1/2 cup snow peas, cut into matchsticks
-   4 ounces firm tofu, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
-   1/4 jicama, cut into matchsticks (optinal)
-   1/4 cup chopped peanuts
-   1/4 cup sunflower or mung bean sprouts
-   1 tbsp chopped fresh cilantro
-   1 tbsp chopped thai basil

Bring 3 liters of water to a boil in a large pot. When the water boils, turn the heat off and add the noodles. Let the noodles soak in the water until they are barely tender, about 15 minutes. Drain the noodles in a colander and rinse with cold water. Reserve.

In a small bowl, combine the lime juice, soy sauce, ketchup, sriracha, and 2 tbsp of water.

Heat the oil in a wide skillet or a wok over medium heat and sauté the garlic and ginger for 30 seconds. Add the carrot and green onions. Sauté for another 1 to 2 minutes, until the carrot is just barely crisp-tender. Add the snow peas, tofu, and jicama and stir briefly. Add the lime juice mixture and stir to coat the tofu and vegetables, being careful not to break up the tofu too much.

Add the noodles and toss or stir until they are fully cooked and heated through, about 2 minutes. Garnish with chopped peanuts, spouts, cilantro, and basil.
