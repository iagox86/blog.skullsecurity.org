On this page, I\'m going to give an overview of some rudimentary research I did on the Warden module for Starcraft. I have only looked at it in the context of Starcraft, and no other game client, so I make no guarantees.

At the current time, I can decrypt packages, and download/prepare modules, but I haven\'t yet looked at how to generate responses for packets. I\'ve decided that I don\'t have time to do that, but I encourage others to pick up where I left off with that.

Anyway, here\'s the stuff I can help with (in some cases with code, some cases without):

-   [Crypto and Hashing](Crypto_and_Hashing "wikilink")
-   [Warden Packets](Warden_Packets "wikilink")
-   [Warden Modules](Warden_Modules "wikilink")

And here\'s some extra goodies

-   [Naming Conventions](Naming_Conventions "wikilink")
-   [Miscellaneous useful \'nippits](Miscellaneous_useful_'nippits "wikilink")
-   [My notes](My_notes "wikilink")

Here are the code samples:

-   [util.Buffer](util.Buffer "wikilink")
-   to be continued
