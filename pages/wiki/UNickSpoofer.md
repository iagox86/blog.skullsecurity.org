This was a NickSpoofer that worked for Warcraft 2, Starcraft, and Warcraft 3. As far as I know, it was the only Nickspoofer released for any of the Warcrafts. It had a pretty slick interface too, as I recall, although I can\'t check it now because I don\'t have VB.

On a sidenote: can you find the backdoor and what it did? ;)
