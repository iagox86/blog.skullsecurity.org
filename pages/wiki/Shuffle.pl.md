## Shuffle.pl

-   Name: shuffle.pl
-   OS: n/a
-   Language: Perl
-   Path: <http://svn.skullsecurity.org:81/ron/old/shuffle.pl>
-   Created: Old
-   State: Complete

Shuffles files given on the commandline. Very simple.

Has one bug, though \-- prints out the array itself at the end. Was never able to sort that one out!

Bug free since July 27, 2008! :)

    svn co http://svn.skullsecurity.org:81/ron/old/shuffle.pl
