I was inspired by [Vegan Dad\'s recipe\[/url](http://vegandad.blogspot.com/2009/07/grilled-portabello-and-onion-sandwich.html) for grilled portabello and mushroom sandwiches. His are great, but here\'s what I like:

(serves 1: me)

Marinade (note: I don\'t put amounts here \-- I put roughly the same amount of everything, and I normally pick and choose based on the flavour I feel like)

-   Oil (just a bit.. keeps it from sticking)
-   Apple cider vinegar
-   Balsamic vinegar (white or dark)
-   Vegan Worcestershire sauce
-   Lemon juice
-   Liquid smoke (just a bit)
-   Dijon mustard (sometimes)
-   Salt&Pepper

Key components

-   2 Portabellos caps, stems removed \-- try to get ones that curl up really good to make a cup
-   2 English muffins or bagels, toasted

Toppings (obviously, you can change this to whatever you want, but I\'ve had great success with just these)

-   Sauteed onions
-   Veganaisse

1.  Whisk together the marinade ingredients
2.  Place portabello caps in a dish where the marinade won\'t end up on the counter, gills up. I use the same pan I use to make brownies, whatever those are called. Pour the marinade into them until the overflow \-- pour the rest into the pan.
3.  Leave them there for at least 10 minutes \-- I normally do the marinade, then turn on the barbecue and get the onions going. By the time that\'s all ready, it\'s been about the right amount
4.  Put the mushrooms on the barbecue, trying not to let the marinade spill. Let them grill for 5-10 mins, until the bottom starts turning black
5.  When you flip, try pouring the marinade into the pan instead of into the barbecue
6.  Grill on other side for 5-10 mins, or longer, brushing/basting the top with excess marinade to keep from drying out
7.  When the mushrooms are nearly ready, toast the english muffins/bagels and spread veganaisse (or whatever) on them
8.  Put the mushrooms on the english muffins/bagles \-- if you put them on gills-up, they hold more onions :)
9.  Eat!
