I got a bundle of asparagus from Fresh Option, and needed something to do with it. So, as usual, I looked up vegan recipes on the Internet. After a bit of searching, I found this [Cream of Asparagus Soup](http://www.recipezaar.com/Cream-of-Asparagus-Soup-vegan-18803) recipe. It was excellent! The best part was, I finally learned how to spell \"Asparagus\"!

Talking to my friend, we decided that it could make a pretty generic cream soup. So, here you have it\...

-   1lb of vegetables (1 bunch asparagus, 1 lb mushrooms, 1 lb broccoli, etc)
-   1 large onion, sliced
-   1-5 clove garlic (I used 3)
-   2 cups vegetable broth
-   1/4 cup unbleached flour (I suspect that corn starch would also work, if you\'re into gluten free)
-   2 1/2 cups soymilk (I used Enriched Silk)
-   2 tablespoons soy sauce or tamari
-   2 teaspoons dried basil
-   salt and pepper

## Directions

1.  Chop the vegetables. Reserve some (the asparagus tips, pieces of mushrooms, etc) for later \-- if you want a chunkier soup, keep more; if you want thinner, keep less.
2.  Put the asparagus, onion, garlic, and broth into a soup pot
3.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat the medium, cook till vegetables are tender (15 mins)
4.  Process the contents of the pot (stick/hand blender is my favourite way, but a food processor or blender work well)
5.  Add flour, soy milk, soy sauce and basil, and continue processing
6.  Return soup to the pan, and add the reserved vegetables
7.  Cook over medium heat until the soup thickens and is heated through (takes a couple minutes, but you can cook it longer if you like it thicker)
8.  Add salt and pepper, serve
