These are the steps to creating a character in my campaign. Note that this is completely different from the official rules. I don\'t like them much.

You should print and use ![](Character_Sheet.pdf "Character_Sheet.pdf")

## Step 1 {#step_1}

Choose a name, gender, history, occupation and any other characteristics that\'ll affect the way you build the character. Keep in mind that this game takes place in the early 1990s.

[List of Occupations](List_of_Occupations "wikilink")

## Step 2 {#step_2}

Determine characteristics.

You begin with **80** stat points (**100** if you write a compelling character history) that you can divide among your eight base stats. No stat may be lower than 1, nor can it be over the value listed.

</tr>


</table>

## Step 3 {#step_3}

Determine derived statistics:

-   Sanity = Power x 5
-   Idea = Intelligence x 5
-   Luck = Power x 5
-   Know = Education x 5
-   Hit Points = Constitution + Size (not /2!)
-   Magic Points = Power
-   Damage Bonus = Strength + Size, on the table below:


<table>


<tr>


<th>

STR + SIZ


</th>


<th>

</th>


</tr>


<tr>


<td>

2 - 12

<tr>


<td>

33 - 40


</td>


<td>

+1d6


</td>


</tr>


<tr>


<td>

41 - 56


</td>


<td>

+2d6


</td>


</tr>


<tr>


<td>

57 - 72


</td>


<td>

+3d6


</td>


</tr>


<tr>


<td>

73 - 88


</td>


<td>

+4d6


</td>


</tr>


</table>

## Step 4 {#step_4}

Determine Skills.

Each skill starts with a base value, listed on the [Skill List](Skill_List "wikilink"). All points spent on skills are added to that base value.

The investigator receives Education x 20 skill points to add to his occupation\'s skills ([List of Occupations](List_of_Occupations "wikilink")).

The investigator receives an additional Intelligence x 15 skill points to add to whichever skill he wants (except for Cthulhu Mythos).
