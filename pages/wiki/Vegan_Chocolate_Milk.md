This was just an idea of mine to get a slightly more creamy chocolate \"milk\" that didn\'t have so much of a soy milk taste to it. Obviously I used it with soy milk, but in theory it should go with any other sort of milk you choose. Pretty quick to make assuming you have the ingredients, and I think it tastes awesome.\
\
1 Tbsp unsweetened cocoa powder\
1 Tbsp sugar (Or to taste)\
1 Tbsp coconut milk\
Hot water\
Soy milk to 1 cup total liquid\
\
Put the cocoa powder into your chosen cup and add enough hot water to dissolve the powder. The consistency should be slightly more watery than syrup. Add the sugar and mix so that all solids are dissolved, and the mixture should be slightly thicker than before. Add the coconut milk and mix again. Add soy milk (Or your chosen other milk) to the mixture and mix one more time. Serve.
