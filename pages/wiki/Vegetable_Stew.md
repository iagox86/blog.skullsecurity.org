This is the first vegan recipe I ever made! It\'s from Terry Pratchett\'s \"Nanny Ogg\'s Cookbook\".

-   1 green pepper, chopped
-   2 carrots, diced
-   3 cloves garlic, chopped
-   300g mushrooms, sliced
-   300mL vegetable broth
-   1 400g can chopped tomatoes
-   1 tbsp paprika
-   1 400g can mixed beans (I normally use kidney, hard to find good mixed ones)
-   1 tbsp balsamic vinegar
-   salt & pepper

1.  Heat the oil and cook the leeks, green pepper, carrot, and garlic for a few minutes
2.  Add the mushrooms and cook for another few minutes
3.  Add the vegetable broth, tomatoes, and paprika
4.  Bring to a boil, let simmer for 15-20 minutes
5.  Add the beans and balsamic vinegar, and season
6.  Cover, simmer for 20-25 minutes
