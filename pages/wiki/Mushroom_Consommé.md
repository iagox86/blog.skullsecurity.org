-   1lb mushrooms, thinly sliced
-   10 sprigs of fresh thyme
-   8 cups of water
-   salt and pepper
-   8 green onions, coarsely sliced (or fine, if you prefer \-- also, I only do the light parts, I throw out the dark green stuff)
-   Soy sauce
-   Cooked rice

Sauté the mushrooms and thyme for about 5 minutes, until the mushrooms just start releasing the juice.

Pour in water, bring to a boil, let simmer for 3 hours (or more).

Pour through a fine streainer, discard mushrooms and thyme (or keep some of the mushrooms to put in the broth). Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Immediately before serving, add the green onions, and optionally add soy sauce and rice (alternatively, put the soy sauce and rice on the table and let people add it themselves).

You may want to boil the broth some more to condense it, or add water to thin it, depending on how strong you like your consommé. If you want to boil it more, or keep left overs, don\'t add the green onions, they\'ll get soggy.
