Last night my friend came over and wanted some chip dip. Unfortunately, I was out of the Lipton mix that I normally use, so I searched for a recipe and found this one. It actually turned out quite well!

-   1 1/2tsp dried parsley
-   1tbsp onion powder
-   1tsp turmeric (optional, for colour)
-   1/2tsp celery seed
-   1/2tsp sugar
-   1/2tsp garlic powder
-   1/4tsp ground pepper
-   Salt (to taste \-- maybe between 1/2tsp and 1tsp)
-   Dried onion flakes (to taste)
-   1 small container of Vegan sour cream (I\'m sure the ordinary kind would also work)

Mix everything together, dip chips in it.
