## Injector

-   Name: Injector
-   OS: Windows
-   Language: C++
-   Path: <http://svn.skullsecurity.org:81/ron/old/Injector>
-   Created: Old
-   State: Stable, needs work

This is an exceptionally useful program I wrote a long time ago, when I was first experimenting with writing plugins/hacks for other programs. It will inject or eject a .dll file (or whatever) into the address space of a running program.

I wrote this a long time ago, and haven\'t touched. It does, however, need some work. Maybe someday I\'ll get around to it?
