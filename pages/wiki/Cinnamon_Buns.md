These are cheating cinnamon buns, but they still taste good!

-   4c flour
-   4tsp baking powder
-   1c white sugar
-   1/2 c margarine
-   pour coconut milk till you can make a ball
-   margarine
-   brown sugar
-   cinnamon

Mix the flour, baking powder, sugar, margarine, and coconut milk together. Mix in coconut milk until you can form it into a ball. Roll it on a floured surface nice and flat, trying to keep it roughly square. Spread the margarine on it, then sprinkle on brown sugar and cinnamon. Roll it all up tightly into a cylinder, and chop it at regular intervals. Pack them fairly tightly into a cooking dish and bake at 350 until they brown.
