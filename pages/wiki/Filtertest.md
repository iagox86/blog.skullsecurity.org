## Filtertest

-   Name: Filtertest
-   OS: Linux
-   Language: Perl
-   Path: <http://svn.skullsecurity.org:81/ron/security/filtertest>
-   Created: 2008
-   State: In progress

This will be a client/server app that allows users to test what\'s being blocked, either by firewalls, by ISPs, etc.

Currently, the server is implemented and I\'m happy with it. I haven\'t started the client yet.

    svn co http://svn.skullsecurity.org:81/ron/security/filtertest
