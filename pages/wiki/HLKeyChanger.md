## HLKeyChanger

-   Name: HLKeyChanger
-   OS: Windows
-   Language: Visual Basic 6

-   Created: Old
-   State: Complete

This is a simple GUI that lets a user change his or her CDKey for the original Halflife. I wrote it because me and Junkyard Dog used to share a key before I bought the game for real.

All it really does is read from/write to the registry, the key is stored there in plaintext.
