From [Vegan Dad](http://vegandad.blogspot.com/2009/08/ultimate-vegan-hot-wingz.html):

Seitan

-   1 cup sliced mushrooms
-   1 small onion, chopped
-   1 garlic clove, chopped
-   2 tbsp olive oil
-   2 tsp poultry spice (I used steak seasoning, it\'s all I had)
-   1 tsp salt
-   1/2 cup water
-   1 cup vital wheat gluten

Breading

-   1/2 cup fine corn flake crumbs (I used corn grits)
-   1/2 cup flour
-   1/2 tsp paprika
-   1/2 tsp salt
-   fresh ground pepper
-   2 tsp oil
-   1 cup soy milk (I used almond milk)
-   1/2 tsp apple cider vinegar

Sauce (heat these ingredients in a saucepan)

-   1/2 cup margarine (I\'d use less next time)
-   1/2 cup hot sauce (I\'d use a lot more next time)
-   1 tbsp vinegar
-   1 tbsp ketchup

METHOD

1.  Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Line a sided cookie sheet with foil and lightly oil.
2.  Place mushrooms, onion, and garlic in a food processor and process until finely chopped. Add oil, spice, salt and water and process into a smooth paste. Add gluten and process into a smooth dough.
3.  Remove dough from food processor and roll into a cylinder about 14\" long. Slice into 1\" pieces and roll them into a smaller cylinders. Slice that in half if they are too long, then flatten slightly.
4.  Mix together ground corn flakes, flour, paprika, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Combine soy milk and vinegar in a separate bowl.
5.  Toss seitan in 2 tsp of oil. Toss seitan in corn flake mixture.
6.  Dip seitan soy milk mixture, then toss in cornflake mixture again. Place on prepared cookie sheet.
7.  Bake for 10 mins, turn over, then bake for another 10 mins.
8.  Coat wingz with all but 1/4 cup of the sauce. Bake for 5 mins, then use a spoon to scoop up excess sauce and recoat the wingz. Bake for another 3-5 mins, until bubbling. Remove from oven and let cool 5 mins. Toss in remaining sauce and serve.
