## FuelPricing

-   Name: FuelPricing
-   OS: Windows
-   Language: Visual Basic 6
-   Path: <http://svn.skullsecurity.org:81/ron/old/FuelPricing>
-   Created: Old
-   State: Complete

This program was pretty slick, for the time. I wrote it for my stepdad, it was designed to scrape a Web site for the fuel prices in each state. It was to help him plan the most efficient routes.

I highly doubt it works anymore, because it had to interpret the HTML on the page.
