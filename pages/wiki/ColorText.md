## ColorText

-   Name: ColorText
-   OS: Java
-   Language: Java
-   Path: <http://svn.skullsecurity.org:81/ron/old/ColorText>
-   Created: Old
-   State: Complete

This is a JTextPane that allows colours to be added. I incorporated it into JavaOp2, and probably changed it a lot since then, but this was stable and worked to the best of my recollection.

    svn co http://svn.skullsecurity.org:81/ron/old/ColorText
