-   3-4 cloves garlic, minced
-   1/2 cup dry white wine
-   1-2 Tbs. fresh thyme
-   1 small piece soy cheese, grated

Directions:

1.  Cook the tagliatelle in salted water according to the instructions on the package.
2.  Heat the oil in a large frying pan.
3.  Saute the red onion until just beginning to turn golden brown.
4.  Add the minced garlic and artichoke pieces.
5.  Saute until the artichokes are lightly browned, turn the heat down to low.
