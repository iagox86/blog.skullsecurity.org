## cattlechat

-   Name: cattlechat
-   OS: Linux, BSD (should work on everything)
-   Language: C
-   Path: <http://svn.skullsecurity.org:81/ron/school/cattlechat>
-   Created: Old
-   State: Complete

This was the final project in Networks 1, 74.406 (properly 74.362, but I took a special section for co-ops). It\'s a chat client/server modeled after Battle.net, written entirely in single-threaded C using the select() system call and an ncurses interface.

I\'m extremely happy with how this program turned out, and I frequently re-use code from it.
