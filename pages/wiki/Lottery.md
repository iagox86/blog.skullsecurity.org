## Lottery

I wrote this little lottery program to demonstrate using an array to keep track of numbers that have been chosen, thus turning an O(exponential) problem into O(1).

Other than that simple demo, there\'s nothing to it. Pick some numbers on the commandline, run the program, and it\'ll tell you how many of the guesses were correct.
