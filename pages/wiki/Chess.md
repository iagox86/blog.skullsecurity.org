I don\'t even remember writing this program, and I have no idea what it is. Apparently, it involves a chessboard. \*shrug\*

From a quick look at the comments I wrote, it seems to be a client for the Chess program I made in 74.319 (AI). So maybe it actually did work afterall, that project definitely did!
