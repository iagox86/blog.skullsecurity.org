This is a Mediterranean dip that\'s not unlike hummous (except that the only ingredient they share is garlic). It\'s a dip based on red peppers, pomegranate syrup, and walnuts. And it\'s surprisingly good! I like to eat it with tortilla chips or on pita bread.

-   7oz jar roasted red peppers, drained
-   2tbsp of corn starch, if you want it thicker
-   1/2c toasted chopped walnuts
-   2 cloves of garlic
-   1tsp lemon juice
-   2 teaspoons pomegranate syrup, pomegranate molasses, or concentrated pomegranate juice (can get it from a Mediterranean store)
-   Olive oil

Puree all ingredients somehow (I use a hand blender or something like that, but a food processor should work too). Add olive oil until it\'s the consistency you want, maybe 1/4c or so. Garnish with walnuts, basil, and lemon wedges.
