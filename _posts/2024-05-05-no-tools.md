[No Tools](https://github.com/BSidesSF/ctf-2024-release/tree/main/no-tools) is a fairly simple terminal challenge, something for new players to chew on.

I suspect there are several different ways to solve it, but the basic idea is to read a file using only built-in functions from `sh`.

I personally solved it with the `read` built-in:

```bash
$ read FLAG < /home/ctf/flag.txt && echo $FLAG
CTF{where-are-my-tools}
```

Another solution that my co-organizer developed used `exec`:

```bash
$ exec < /home/ctf/flag.txt
$ /bin/sh: 2: CTF{where-are-my-tools}: not found
```
